A fix to show bootstrap value on figtree startup
Figtree https://github.com/rambaut/figtree is a powerful phylogenetic tree viewer, but it does not show labels(e.g. bootstrap value) by default. To show those labels, users have to click the 'Branch Labels panel' and choose. Thos is not so convenient when there are dozens of tree files to be viewed.
This version automatically show label from tree on startup. When no label found, it shows the branch times.
